          To understand Sri Lanka is to understand movement: west to east, coast to hill country, monsoon to sunlight,
          ceremony to stillness. A journey here is most rewarding when it follows the island rather than forcing it.

            Regions, seasons, and private moments sit close together in Sri Lanka. The interactive map is where these
            relationships become visible: coast beside wilderness, tea country near sacred cities, and routes shaped by

        <p>
          Some travellers remember Sri Lanka in the hush of tea country before the day warms. Others carry home the
          colour of temple flowers, the salt of a southern evening, or the long quiet between ancient stones. You have
          met the island in its regions, seasons, and rhythms. The next chapter is simply to notice which of those
