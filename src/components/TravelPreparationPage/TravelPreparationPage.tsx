              <h3>The first ritual of the journey</h3>
              <p>
                On arrival, you are invited to pause over a complimentary cup of Ceylon tea in a setting chosen for
                calm, privacy, and unhurried welcome. It is not simply refreshment after a flight. It is the symbolic
                beginning of every Royale Isles Lanka journey.

            </article>
            <article>
              <h3>While you settle, the island begins to open</h3>
              <p>
                As tea is poured, conversations continue softly around you. Introductions are confirmed, the evening
                finds its shape, and the first day settles into place without asking anything of you.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article>
              <h3>The journey has already begun</h3>
              <p>
                There is no rush to solve, organise, or ask what comes next. The welcome tea is a gentle threshold
                between the long flight and the island itself: a moment of stillness before Sri Lanka opens around you.
