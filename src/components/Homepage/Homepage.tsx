              The island is not revealed by covering more ground. It is revealed by knowing which door

              Sri Lanka is compact enough for an unhurried private journey and layered enough for a

              For select journeys, memory is part of the craft. A discreet visual host can travel
              alongside the guest, preserving the unposed details: the first tea estate sunrise, the
              private table by the sea, the silence after a leopard crosses the track.
